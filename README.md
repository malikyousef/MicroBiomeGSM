# MicroBiomeNET


In this paper, we introduce some basic concepts, tools, and methods known as MicroBiomeNet to computationally determine the molecular pathways that govern microbe-host associations.

The goal is to use machine learning (G-S-M) to uncover the impact of microbiome sequencing on specific diseases. 

First, microbiomes are determined by taxon levels for the diseases under study. Then, a degree of importance is assigned to the groups formed by the taxon levels. The score is a predictor of how well taxa can be classified based on the microbiomes that belong to a disease. In addition, when groups are formed based on importance, the best microbiomes are identified and ranked in order of importance scores. Finally, the model is created and the evaluation criteria are obtained by training the classifier to evaluate the predictive performance of MicroBiomeNET.
