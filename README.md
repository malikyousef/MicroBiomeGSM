# MicroBiomeNET

In this paper, we introduce some basic concepts, tools, and methods known as MicroBiomeNet to computationally determine the molecular pathways that govern microbe-host associations.

The goal is to use machine learning (G-S-M) to uncover the impact of microbiome sequencing on specific diseases.
